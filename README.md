2048 - The tile game everyone knows.

This repository will eventually include a python
file for a single-player game, the option to run a
computer simulation of the game, and (possibily),
the ability to run a two player game.

The idea is, of course, the same as that of the
original game. The main difference is that u, d,
l, and r, are used instead of swipes, arrow keys,
or any other form of input.

The two player game will work with the same
controls, but the players will each have their own
board, and take turns making moves. Additionally,
move is made by player one will also occur on
player two's board, adding an element of strategy
to the game.
